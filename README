Make sure your project shows off code for each step of the challenge you complete. If you build an interesting user interface, make sure to include screenshots in your repository’s readme file.

Step I: Registration

To get started, you’re first going to connect to the registration endpoint. It lives here:

http://challenge.code2040.org/api/register

The registration endpoint expects a JSON dictionary with two keys, token and github. This JSON should be sent in the body of your HTTP request.

For token, pass in a string with the token you see above. For github, pass in the URL of the repository you created in the last step.

Hint: HTTP has a few types of “methods.” The registration endpoint is going to be expecting you to use POST to send your JSON.
